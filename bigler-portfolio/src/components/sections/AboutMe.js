        <p>
          Hi there! I'm a born-and-raised midwesterner, with a passion for STEM and coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from KU with a BS in Molecular Biology, and worked in a clinical diagnostics lab for three and a half years.
          Lab work was fulfilling, but there was something missing - creativity and problem solving.
          I sought out ways to increase creativity and problem-solving in my day-to-day duties,
          including leading committees and taking on extra compliance responsibilities,
          but nothing quite scratched the itch enough.

          Then, a friend recommended freecodecamp.org. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not long after, I enrolled in KU's full stack developer bootcamp, 
          a 24 week course with hands-on experience building apps. 
          The course delved in to topics including Object Oriented Programming, responsive web design, API design, and the MERN stack, just to name a few.
          I graduated and earned my certificate at the end of May, 2023.

          or take a look at my Portfolio tab for a few of my favorite projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm open to work, and looking forward to getting my hands dirty in some code.
